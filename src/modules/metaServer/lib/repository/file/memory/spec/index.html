    A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website,
    the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen. Browsers are used
    on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion
    people have used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices,
    followed by Safari with 18%.

    A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a
    website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages,
    a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.
